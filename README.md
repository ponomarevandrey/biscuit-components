# About

**Biscuit** is a UI component/pattern library for developing websites based on BEM methodology and a mobile-first approach.

Biscuit splits up all page elements into reusable BEM-blocks (components) implemented in Sass/JavaScript/Pug. Examples of such blocks are `btn`, `lightbox`, `heading`, `grid-gallery`, ...

## Why I built it

My primary goals were:
* to learn Webpack
* to learn BEM methodology
* to re-learn CSS (mainly new, modern stuff like Flexbox and CSS Grid) alongside learning SASS
* to practice object-oriented JavaScript by implementing some components as ES6 classes

As of December 2019, all of the beforementioned goals are reached (though the project needs a large amount of refactoring and reconsideration of many things). 

Frankly speaking, I realized that my attempt to build such a framework was a bit too ambitious and it will take me much more time to finish this project. 

I continue the development but without setting any fixed finishing date and consider this project to be a playground where I'm constantly experimenting and learning new things.
