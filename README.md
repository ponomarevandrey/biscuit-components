# About

**Biscuit** is a UI components/code snippets library for developing websites based on BEM methodology and a mobile-first approach.

Biscuit splits up all page elements into reusable BEM-blocks (components) implemented in Sass/JavaScript/Pug. Examples of such blocks are `btn`, `lightbox`, `heading`, `grid-gallery`, ...

# Motivation

My primary goals were:

* to learn Webpack
* to learn BEM methodology
* to re-learn CSS (mainly new, modern stuff like Flexbox and CSS Grid) alongside learning SASS

# Current State

Currently, I reached all of the aforementioned goals and stopped developing the project. I use code snippets from this library in all of my projects as a starting point.
