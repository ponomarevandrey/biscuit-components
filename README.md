# About

**Biscuit** is a minimalist component library/boilerplate for developing websites/apps based on BEM methodology and a mobile-first approach.

Biscuit splits up all page elements into reusable BEM-blocks (components) implemented in Sass/JavaScript/Pug. Typical examples of such blocks are 'accordion', 'btn', 'text', 'heading', 'form-group', 'grid-gallery', 'select', 'nav', ...

## Why I built it

Sometimes there is a need to create just a simple landing page or a small website. Using CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Foundation would be an obvious solution, but ... I like to keep things as simple as possible and to have no redundant code. Also, I like to understand how my tool (framework) works under the hood. That is why I built Biscuit. When I need to develop a small page/website I copy the entire component folder or chunks of code to my new project, add/edit some files and that's it.
